A major leak in the emergency line will cause the tractor protection valve to close and the trailer emergency brakes to come on, but the brakes will hold only if there is air pressure in the trailer air tank. Eventually, the air will leak away and then there will be no brakes. Therefore, it is very important for safety that you use wheel chocks when you park trailers without spring brakes.",
